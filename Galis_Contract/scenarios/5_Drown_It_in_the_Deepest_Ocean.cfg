#SCENARIO 5: Drown It in the Deepest Ocean (952 SI, February)
#Volur had ported to somewhere nearby - on the surface, presumably, since there were no nearby caverns. We rushed out of the River Ransal entrance, hoping to catch him before he could get away with Stormbreaker.
#
#Leaving the tunnels, we saw Volur heading down the mountainside straight towards the sea. We called after him, trying, with threats, bribes, and pleas, to convince him to return the sword to us, but he said he was going to 'drown it in the deepest ocean', and there was nothing we could do about it. All seemed lost - he could easily outpace us, reaching the sea long before any of us. Fortune was with us, however; Volur ran into a patrol of Issaelfr and was detained in the fields of Frey-Issaeri Manor.
#
#We approached those holding him captive, but Syren dra'Friysn, the daughter of Lord Friysr, refused to turn him over to us. He was her captive, she said, and would remain so until she knew why he was there. We could not possibly tell her; there was no choice but to attack the Issaelfr in order to reclaim Stormbreaker from Volur. We did so.
#
#When the dust of the battlefield lifted, Syren was dead, and Volur as well, felled as he tried to escape and make his way to the ocean to finish what he started. We had retaken Stormbreaker. The price was high, but we had retaken Stormbreaker, and all our enemies had fallen. All that remained was to deliver it.
