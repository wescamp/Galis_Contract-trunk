#SCENARIO 3: Through Fire and Ice (951 SI, December)
#We traveled south for several days, the snow piling ever higher. As we walked, Trondar and I discussed our options. We would be frozen if we did not find shelter soon - but where? Ideally, we would find a minor cave entrance and barricade ourselves there while we forged the sword. I had only glanced over the books we had stolen, but they appeared to give us the information we needed. If we could not find that, though, what other options did we have? The was also the problem of the bears - we had heard fierce growling from beyond the firelight the night before.
#
#Trondar proposed we try to make our way down, out of the mountains, and try to contact the Issaelfr. They might be able to help us - either give us shelter, or direct us to somewhere safe. If nothing else, it would bring us further away from Lokka and his menn, and perhaps throw them off of our trail. And so we did so. We had to use dwarven torches to fight our way through the ice bears to get there, but eventually we made our way to Frey-Issaeri Manor, the home of the lord Friysr.
#
#Friysr refused to give us shelter in his own manor without knowing why we could not go back underground. This we could not tell him - Trondar rightly stopped me from doing so, for the troubles of our people cannot be known to the outside world - but he was able to tell us where the nearest minor entrance was. Thus we quickly made our way to the River Ransal Entrance and forced our way in. We were, finally, out of the cold. In return, I told Friysr what he would be grieved to hear - Alfhelm planned to attack Vaniyera and would need his help if the entire Marauder-Issaelfr alliance was not to dissolve.
