#SCENARIO 2: Our Friends in the North (951 SI, December)
#The outlaw incursion, though put down without immense difficulty, troubled me. Seldom did men discover our hiding place by themselves, and seldom did they try to take us by force... but we attributed it to the chaos caused by the fall  of the Empire, nothing more.
#
#For the next week, Trondar and I delved into the lore of the thunderblades, looking for a weakness to exploit. We read through everything in the forge library that might be relevant, to no avail. We had no documents about the forging of the thunderblades.
#
#Finally, I admitted defeat. I knew that the thunderblades had been forged in the tunnels of the Alfenheim dwarves, the tunnels of Lord Lokka; perhaps there was something in their library describing the blades' runic structure.
#
#We had little choice but to go there, and traveling over land would take much too long. We dispatched a message to the Alfenheim tunnels, requesting permission to travel via their lodestone. They granted it.
#
#When I arrived there, however, I found myself surrounded and under arrest by the order of the monitor Volur, acting under Lokka's authority. I quickly sent off a message through the lodestone to Trondar, telling him to bring reinforcements to me, and quickly, and to come himself if possible. He came just in time, and we broke through the guards who tried to arrest me, captured Volur, and forced him to tell us where to find the book we were looking for. He somehow teleported away from captivity after revealing this information.
#
#Lokka himself arrived on the scene soon after this, coming through the tunnels in the north and leading a large army. Luckily, the book was located on the opposite side of the cavern, and we were able to locate it and leave the caverns with his warriors at our heels. When we got outside the caves, we slammed the doors behind us, and found that we had locked ourselves out in the cold, with a winter storm approaching.
