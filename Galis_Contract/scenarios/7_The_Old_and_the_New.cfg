#SCENARIO 7: The Old and the New (952 SI, March)
#Alfhelm was satisfied with his purchase, and our business was concluded. But I could not bear to leave just then; I had to see if the Stormbreaker would truly break the storm. I witnessed the duel between Alfhelm and Vaniyera, and can say truly that yes, it can.
#
#It was time to leave the Alfhelm commission behind and return to Dverkenn Tarn. We were in no hurry, and our eagles had been exhausted by the marathon we had made them fly; we left them behind, and began the journey on foot. All was quiet until we had almost left the forestlands behind us.
#
#Then came what was, in a way, the darkest hour of our journey. Walking through the forests, we crossed paths with Faolan, the south Thunderblade of the Western March. He had heard of Vaniyera's death and the breaking of the power of the thunderblades, and saw that none but the hidden folk - our folk - could have crafted a weapon such as Stormbreaker.
#
#What he did not see was why we had done so. Were we, he asked bitterly, going to slay him with a stormbreaker as well? We denied any ill will towards him - we had only been fulfilling a contract. He did not believe us, or, if he did, he refused to see that as a motive strong enough to commit what he saw as sacrilege. We had fought him with hammer and anvil; now, he would force us to fight him with spear and axe.
#
#The Sidhe who are made Thunderblades are dread fighters, but the power had gone from Faolan's blade. He was naught but a mann, strong as he was. He forced us to attack him, and we killed him for it. All the Thunderblades, I think, will end this way.
