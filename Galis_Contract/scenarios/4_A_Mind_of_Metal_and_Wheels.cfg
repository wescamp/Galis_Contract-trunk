#SCENARIO 4: A Mind of Metal and Wheels (952 SI, February)
#We seized control of the River Ransal minor entrance in late December of the year in which Alfhelm returned to the north. Only a minor entrance, it had no lodestone, and we were forced to spend the winter there. For the next month, Trondar and I studied the runic structure of the thunderblades, searching for a weakness. We did not find one. Lokka's ancestors had done their work well; the blades could not be harmed by the runes of fire, the runes of iron, the runes of water, or the runes of stone...
#
#Invincible, then. Or so Trondar and I believed. But then I had an idea. Perhaps runes could not break a thunderblade... but steel could snap, runes or no. Do not carve counter-runes; simply ignore the runes and make a sword that is strong enough, heavy enough, to break it by itself. Of course, the steel of the thunderblades, ignoring all the runes, was still a formidable opponent. We would need... something never seen before.
#
#What I ended up forging - and it took me two months, until midway through February, to finish it - was part sword, part mace, and part natural mechanism. It had no runes carved upon it save one, on the hilt, giving it its name - Stormbreaker. And, if my reading of the thunderblade schematics was correct, it would live up to its title.
#
#The day Stormbreaker was completed, Trondar - always the monitor - ran into the forge to warn me that enemies approached. Lokka, it seemed, had left the main Alfenheim Caverns before the ice thawed and came south, searching for us. The elves unwittingly turned him onto our trail, and now he was at our gates. He did not know of Stormbreaker's forging, but he knew our intent; he was there to stop what had already come to pass.
#
#They came in as if peacefully, and bandied words with us; in short, they demanded two things - the return of the book we had stolen, and the return of the River Ransal entrance we had taken over. The first we were willing to give them, the second we were not. We would not be their prisoners. Our acquiescence to the first demand revealed to them that Stormbreaker was complete; our refusal of the second gave them an excuse to attack us. They did so. Lokka marshalled their attack on the tunnel entrance, while Volur tried to sneak past us and steal the sword from the forge room.
#
#After a hard-fought battle, we were able to capture both of them. We took them to the forge room and forced them to tell us why they had attacked us, though I suspected the reason already. Lokka confirmed that they wanted to stop the creation of Stormbreaker. When I revealed it had already been completed, he tried to convince me to destroy it; when I refused, he seized it from my grasp and threw it to Volur, who had been secretly constructing a runic spell to teleport him to safety. Trondar killed Lokka trying to prevent the theft, but it was too late; Volur had escaped with the sword.
